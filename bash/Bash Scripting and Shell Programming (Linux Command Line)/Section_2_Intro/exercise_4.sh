# Exercise 4:
#
# Write a shell script to check to see if the file "/etc/shadow" exists. 
# If it does exist, display "Shadow passwords are enabled." 
# Next, check to see if you can write to the file. 
# If you can, display "You have permissions to edit /etc/shadow." 
# If you cannot, display "You do NOT have permissions to edit /etc/shadow."
